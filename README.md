## 🧪 Business Questions Answered

1. What are the monthly net revenue trends?
2. Which products are top sellers?
3. What is the refund rate?
4. Which customer regions generate the most revenue?

## ✅ Project Questions & Answers

**1. What are the monthly net revenue trends?**  
Sales were strong at the beginning of the year and peaked in March, with total revenue reaching its highest point. This spike was driven by increased hoodie and jogger sales, possibly due to colder weather or promotional efforts.

**2. Which products are top sellers?**  
Hoodies generated the most revenue overall, showing they are a key product line. Joggers and T-Shirts also performed well. On the other hand, Hats and Sweaters had lower revenue, which could indicate lower demand or less marketing.

**3. What is the refund rate?**  
Out of 50+ orders, only 2 were refunded, resulting in a 4% refund rate. This is relatively low and suggests high customer satisfaction, good sizing accuracy, or few product defects.

**4. Which customer regions generate the most revenue?**  
New York and Texas were the most profitable regions, followed by California, Illinois, and Florida. These top regions likely reflect a mix of strong population centers and product-market fit. A marketing focus in 
these areas could further boost revenue.
